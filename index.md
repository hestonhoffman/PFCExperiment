## An overview of CI/CD with Pipelines for Containers

**Continuous integration** (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository on a regular basis. Each check-in is verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

**Continuous deployment** (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce valuable software in short cycles and ensure that the software can be reliably built, tested, and deployed. The build, test, and deploy processes are automated.

Pipelines for Containers was created to enable powerful container-focused CI/CD for teams of all sizes. For a step-by-step introduction to Pipelines for Containers, visit our [Continuous containers on Kubernetes tutorial](./kubernetes-continuous.html).
