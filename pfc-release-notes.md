## Known issues

**Renamed required status check for protected branches in GitHub and GitHub Enteprise**
As part of our rebranding efforts, we renamed a required status check for protected branches in GitHub and GitHub Enterprise. Users of protected branches who have enabled this required status check must follow the instructions below to switch to the new status check. 

To fix this issue: 

1. In the GitHub or GitHub enterprise web UI, go to your repository's **Settings** and click **Branches**, then click **Edit** next to your protected branch.
1. In the status checks area, deselect **continuous-integration/distelli** and select **continuous-integration/puppet**, then save your changes.
